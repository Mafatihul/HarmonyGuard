## Machine Learning

### Technologies
We fine-tune the Transformer model to detect hate comment using TensorFlow and Keras.

### Future work
This model need to improve an accuracy to detect more hate comments

=================
## Mobile Development

### Technologies
We create an application android using Kotlin with IDE Android Studio

### Usage/Examples
Exampel of this project can see with this link:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cOJGdy2Ar0rA7yuFysDmGQw9FJx3aZ0v/view?usp=drive_link

And this is the libraries we used to build the android application:
* [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/)
* [Glide](https://bumptech.github.io/glide/)


### Future work
This project need to explore again such as UI/UX Design, more feature.

=================
## Cloud Computing

### Techonologies
We create an API with framework and database with mySQL

### Future work
This API need to improve again especially usage of model from machine learning and more feature API.
